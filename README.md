Welcome to this bachelors project! This repository contains the code for a website dedicated to concept translations, aimed at facilitating the translation process for various concepts across different languages and cultures.

## About the Project

The bachelor project is a part of Lea Madelen Hals Hansen og Berit Holen Friis√∏'s Bachelor's degree program in computer science, where we have explored the challenges and opportunities in translating specialized concepts. The website serves as a platform where users can suggest translations for specific concepts and collaborate with others in refining and approving these translations.

## Features

* User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out securely to access the platform's features.
* Concept Suggestions: Users can suggest translations for various concepts and contribute to building a comprehensive database of translations.
* Role-based Access: Editors and administrators have additional privileges to approve suggested translations and manage the platform's content.
* User Profiles: Each user has a profile where they can manage their suggested translations and view their activity on the platform.
* Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

Frontend: The frontend of the website is built using React.js, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.

Backend: The backend is developed using .NET, providing robust APIs for handling user authentication, concept suggestions, and all of the other functionalities.

Database: Azure SQL is used to store user data, concept suggestions, and other information.

Styling: The website's styling is done using CSS and Bootstrap for a modern and visually appealing look.
